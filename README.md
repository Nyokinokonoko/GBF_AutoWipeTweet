# GBF_AutoWipeTweet
Nodejs script to auto wipe tweet by GBF

Note: You will need a set of OAuth details with user context (this script uses v1.0a via API v1.1 using Twit). The original approach was to completely use v2 but I could not manage to get the OAuth with PKCE working. The search part uses v2 so you will need a bearer token too (or rewrite the search part to use v1.1).

This script, or me is not associated with Twitter or Cygames.
